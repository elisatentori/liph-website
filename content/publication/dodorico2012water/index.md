# Abstract
Life in terrestrial ecosystems depends on freshwater water, a resource that is becoming scarce. Demographic growth and the increase in per capita use of food, fibers, and other ecosystem services, are directly or indirectly enhancing the societal pressure on the global freshwater resources. Meeting the competing water needs of ecosystems and societies is a major challenge that mankind has to face today. Research in hydrology is trying to clarify the complex patterns of societal dependence on water. Critical interactions between hydrosphere and anthroposphere are associated with food production, which accounts for most of the human appropriation of the global freshwater resources. Some aspects of the societal and hydrologic controls on food security remain poorly understood, including the way societies virtually enhance their access to freshwater resources through trade and globalization; the drivers of virtual water trade; the uncertainties associated with the estimation of the virtual water balance at different scales; and the dependence of demographic dynamics on water availability. These points are here discussed along with their impacts on food security, water solidarity, equity, societal resilience and environmental stewardship.
