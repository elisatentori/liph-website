# Abstract
Understanding the assembly of ecosystems to estimate the number of species at different spatial scales is a challenging problem. Until now, maximum entropy approaches have lacked the important feature of considering space in an explicit manner. We propose a spatially explicit maximum entropy model suitable to describe spatial patterns such as the species area relationship and the endemic area relationship. Starting from the minimal information extracted from presence/absence data, we compare the behavior of two models considering the occurrence or lack thereof of each species and information on spatial correlations. Our approach uses the information at shorter spatial scales to infer the spatial organization at larger ones. We also hypothesize a possible ecological interpretation of the effective interaction we use to characterize spatial clustering.
