# Abstract
Spatial configuration is fundamental in defining the structural and functional properties of biological systems. Biofilms, surface-attached and matrix-enclosed microorganisms, are a striking example of spatial organisation. Coupled biotic and abiotic processes shape the spatial organisation across scales of the landscapes formed by these benthic biofilms in streams and rivers. Experimenting with such biofilms in streams, we found that, depending on the streambed topography and the related hydrodynamic microenvironment, biofilm landscapes form increasingly diverging spatial patterns as they grow. Strikingly, however, cluster size distributions tend to converge even in contrasting hydrodynamic microenvironments. To reproduce the observed cluster size distributions we used a continuous, size-structured population model. The model accounts for the formation, growth, erosion and merging of biofilm clusters. Our results suggest not only that hydrodynamic forcing induce the diverging patterning of the microbial landscape, but also that microorganisms have developed strategies to equally exploit spatial resources independently of the physical structure of the microenvironment where they live.
