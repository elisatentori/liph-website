# Abstract
Obtaining adiabatic processes that connect equilibrium states in a given time represents a challenge for mesoscopic systems. In this paper, we explicitly show how to build these finite-time adiabatic processes for an overdamped Brownian particle in an arbitrary potential, a system that is relevant at both the conceptual and the practical level. This is achieved by jointly engineering the time evolutions of the binding potential and the fluid temperature. Moreover, we prove that the second principle imposes a speed limit for such adiabatic transformations: there appears a minimum time to connect the initial and final states. This minimum time can be explicitly calculated for a general compression or decompression situation.
