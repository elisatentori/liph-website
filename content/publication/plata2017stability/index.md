# Abstract
In kinetic theory, a system is usually described by its one-particle distribution function $f(r,v,t)$, such that $f(r,v,t)drdv$ is the fraction of particles with positions and velocities in the intervals $(r,r+dr)$ and $(v,v+dv)$, respectively. Therein, global stability and the possible existence of an associated Lyapunov function or $H$ theorem are open problems when nonconservative interactions are present, as in granular fluids. Here, we address this issue in the framework of a lattice model for granularlike velocity fields. For a quite general driving mechanism, including both boundary and bulk driving, we show that the steady state reached by the system in the long-time limit is globally stable. This is done by proving analytically that a certain $H$ functional is nonincreasing in the long-time limit. Moreover, for a quite general energy injection mechanism, we are able to demonstrate that the proposed $H$ functional is nonincreasing for all times. Also, we put forward a proof that clearly illustrates why the “classical” Boltzmann functional $H_B [f]=\int drdvf(r,v,t)lnf(r,v,t)$ is inadequate for systems with nonconservative interactions. This is done not only for the simplified kinetic description that holds in the lattice models analyzed here but also for a general kinetic equation, like Boltzmann's or Enskog's.
