I'm Damiano Sgarbossa, a Master student in Physics at the University of Padova. I'm currently working at my Master thesis at the LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Samir Suweis and prof. Sandro Azaele.
My thesis concerns the study of the Complexity-Stability paradox in ecology and my main research interests regard: physics of complex systems, dynamical and chaotic systems and statistical physics.
