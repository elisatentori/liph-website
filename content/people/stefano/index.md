I am Stefano Garlaschi,  a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padova, working in the Liph Lab under the supervision of the professor Amos Maritan.
My interest in the interdisciplinary physics was born during my Bachelor thesis and it was confirmed with my Master thesis. Both of the works were performed within the LIPh Lab group under the guidance of prof. Maritan and Dr. Formentin.
My research interests are currently addressed to the study of different aspects of population dynamics, modelling and tackling these kind of systems with deterministic and stochastic models.
