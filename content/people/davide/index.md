I'm Davide Colì, and I am currently a post-doc researcher woring for prof. Samir Suweis.

Last year, I've completed my PhD here at the University of Padua where I studied the basic features of chromatin organization and how they do connect to epigenetics expression.

Nowadays, I am working on a network model, in collaboration with the local public transport company (BusItalia Veneto s.p.a), in order to optimize the passengers flux on the public transport (bus/trams) network.
