I'm Maria Elena Corrias, Master's student at the University of Bologna. I'm currently working in the LIPh lab for my thesis, under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan and Prof. Marco Formentin. My interests range from statistical physics to complex systems and, in particular, I'm fascinated by modeling problems related to biology and medicine.
