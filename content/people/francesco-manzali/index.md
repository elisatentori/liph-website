I'm Francesco Manzali, a Master student currently enrolled in the Master of Physics of Data at the University of Padova.

I'm interested in Machine Learning and Computational Neuroscience, especially in using more "exotic" architectures, such as deep learning on graphs, or bio-inspired learning rules. 
Inspired by my physics background, I seek simple underlying rules for complex phenomena.

My bachelor's thesis was on deep learning in a spherical domain for reconstructing the energy of neutrinos. After that, I moved towards complex systems and theoretical neuroscience. I'm currently working at my Master's thesis at the LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Samir Suweis, investigating the fundamental rules that arise when networks (such as the human brain) store and recall memories.
