I'm Giacomo Barzon, a Master student in Physics of Data at the University of Padova.

Over the years I have developed a strong interest on biological and complex systems, mainly in the field of neuroscience, along with good knowledge of computational simulations, data analysis and machine learning techniques.

Iâ€™m currently working at my Master thesis at the LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Samir Suweis. My thesis concerns the study of a stochastic model built on top of the connectivity matrix between brain areas, the so called human "connectome", with the aim of getting more insight into the relation between brain architecture and its function.
