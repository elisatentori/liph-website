I'm Clelia Corridori, a Physics of Data student at the University of Padova.

I am interested in Complex Systems, Cognitive Modelling, Neuroscience, Machine Learning and in the interdisciplinary approach to tackle these subjects.

My bachelor's thesis was focused on methods and techniques for verifying the unpredictability of states in a sequence of bits. Afterward, my studies were mainly in the areas of complex systems and machine learning. Now my Master's thesis develops in the field of computational Neuroscience, under the supervision of prof. Samir Suweis. I'm studying neuronal networks both using a biological neurons model and the inverse Ising problem.
