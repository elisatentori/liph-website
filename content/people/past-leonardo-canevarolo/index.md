I'm Leonardo Canevarolo, a master student in Mathematical Engineering at the University of Padua and I'm currently writing my thesis at LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Samir Suweis. I'm interested in the applications of statistical physics in Computer Science, in particular in Machine Learning. Indeed my work is entitled ‘‘A Statistical Physics View of Deep Neural Networks’’ and it deals with the interpretability of Restricted Boltzmann Machines through the experimental study of the phases that describe their behaviour in different regions of the hyperparameters space.
