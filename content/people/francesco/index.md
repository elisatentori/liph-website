My name is Andrea Veronese. I am a Master's degree student at the University of Padua.

During my Master's degree studies I got interested and focused mainly on Complex Systems problems and the application of Statistical Mechanics in Biological Physics. More broadly, I am interested and fascinated by the emergence of coherent and collective behavoiur in biological systems.

I am currently working on my Master's thesis under the supervision of Prof. Amos Maritan and Prof. Samir Suweis. My research focuses on the emergence of critical behaviour in living systems. The goal is to deeply understand how and why criticality emerges in interacting living systems and how the strategy with which agents of the system interact with each other can influence this critical behaviour through an approach that merges computational modelling and theoretical models.
