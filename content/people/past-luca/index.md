I am Luca Baroni, a master thesist from Universit√† di Milano Bicocca working under the supervision of professor Amos Maritan and professor Samir Suweis at the Liph Lab.

My research interests regard the interconnection between statistical physics and machine learning and the contributions that each of the two fields can bring to the other.

My current thesis concerns the implementation of a real space renormalization group algorithm exploiting RBMs, a type of generative artificial neural networks
