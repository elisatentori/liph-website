My name is Emanuele Pigani. I am a graduate student in Physics at the University of Padova, where I focused on topics in fundamental and applied non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics. I am currently working in the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics under the supervision of Amos Maritan and Sandro Azaele.

My main research interest focus on the mathematical modelling of biological systems: in particular, I study consumer-resource models for explaining how critical properties (like coexistence) emerge in consumer-resource systems. More in general, I have a deep interest in understanding all the fundamental laws that underlie the reality. As Terenzio used to says,  "Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto‚Äù.
