I am Federica Lorenzi, Masterâ€™s student in Physics at the University of Padua. I am currently working on my thesis at LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Suweis. I'm interested in the Physics of Complex Systems, especially in its applications in Neuroscience field.  Indeed, my thesis deals with the characterization of brain networks in terms of their controllability, drawing on concepts and methods of control theory.
