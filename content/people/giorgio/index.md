I’m Giorgio Nicoletti, Master’s student in Physics at the University of Padua and I’m currently working on my thesis at LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Maritan and prof. Suweis. I’m particularly interested in the statistical mechanics of critical phenomena and its fascinating connection with very different fields, such as the study of brain activity. My thesis deals with Renormalization Group approaches to the emergent collective behavior of networks of neurons, in the pursuit of possible signatures of criticality.
