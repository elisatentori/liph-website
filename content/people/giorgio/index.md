I’m Giorgio Nicoletti, a PhD student in Physics at the University of Padua working at the LIPh lab under the supervision of prof. Maritan and prof. Suweis. I’m particularly interested in the Statistical Mechanics of critical phenomena and its fascinating connection with very different fields, such as the study of brain activity. Indeed, my master's thesis dealt with Renormalization Group approaches to the emergent collective behavior of networks of neurons, in the pursuit of possible signatures of criticality both in archetypal models and in real data.
