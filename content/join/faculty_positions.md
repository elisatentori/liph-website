The Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Padova invites applications for a position of Senior Research Fellow (RtdA under Italian Law) in Theoretical Physics of Matter.

The RtdA is a three-year faculty position, possibly renewable for two further years. After a succesful initial period, the RTDA fellow is expected to apply for a tenure-track RtdB position in our group or in other Italian universities to become an Associate Professor.

The RtdA duties are focused on research and include teaching (no more than 90 hours of frontal lesson per year, typically less). The RtdA will join the theoretical physics of matter group of the

Department of Physics and Astronomy, currently consisting of 15 staff members and about 20 postdocs and PhD students. Active research lines encompass quantum physics, including quantum technologies and ab-initio simulations, both equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium statistical physics, and related interdisciplinary applications to complex and biological systems. The successful candidate is expected to actively contribute to existing research lines and to establish her/his own ones. Expertise in Information Theory, Physics of Machine Learning, and Big Data Analytics are particularly welcomed.

The gross salary will be approximatively â‚¬ 36.000 per year. Only 10% of the gross salary will be taxed if the research fellow is moving to Italy after at least two years spent abroad.

Deadline is 4 June and the official application is available online [here](https://pica.cineca.it/unipd/). Cod: 2020RUA01

For additional information liphlab@unipd.it and visit the [Department's website](https://www.dfa.unipd.it/index.php?id=2015) (in Italian) for more details on the application procedure.
