The Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Padova invites applications from highly motivated and outstanding candidates for two PhD positions in the Laboratory of Interdisciplinary Physics (Statistical Mechanics of Complex Systems). Our Lab addresses a wide range of fundamental problems pertaining to biological complexity, including critical phenomena in living interacting systems, quantitative modelling of biodiversity across scales of ecological complexity and statistical physics approaches to neuroscience. Diverse efforts are mainly geared towards the search for common physical principles underlying biological phenomena.

The successful candidates will work on stochastic modelling of complex ecological communities where a central role will be played by the physics of disordered systems. Another track of research will focus on critical phenomena and scaling laws in biological systems across scales. Applications due on November 30th, 2022 (https://www.unipd.it/dottorato/bandi-graduatorie from November 1st). Further details upon request (sandro.azaele [at] unipd.it or amos.maritan [at] unipd.it).
