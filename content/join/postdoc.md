The Department of Physics & Astronomy at the University of Padua (Italy) invites applications from highly motivated and outstanding candidates for a post-doctoral position (RtdA) in the LIPH lab (Statistical Mechanics of Complex Systems). Our Lab addresses a wide range of fundamental problems pertaining to biological complexity, including critical phenomena in living interacting systems, quantitative modelling of biodiversity across scales of ecological complexity and statistical physics approaches to neuroscience. Diverse efforts are mainly geared towards the search for common physical principles underlying biological phenomena. The successful candidate will develop models for understanding universal empirical patterns in complex ecological communities. They will characterise specific features of interacting living systems by using tools borrowed from non-equilibrium statistical physics, including the physics of disordered systems. Further details on the post upon request (sandro.azaele [at] unipd.it  or amos.maritan [at] unipd.it). After 18/11 details on the application process will be available [at this link](http://www.dfa.unipd.it/servizi/settore-direzione-ricerca-e-terza-missione/concorsi-e-selezioni/ricercatore/selezioni-aperte-o-in-svolgimento/){:target="_blank"}<!--_-->.

  <li>Statistical Physics modelling of Ecological systems</li>
  <li>Non Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</li>
  <li>Applied Stochastic Processes</li>
  <li>Biologically inspired Complex Systems</li>
</ul>  



**Salary**: Depending on candidate expertise. Competitive for Italian living standards.

**Formal requirements**: Candidates should hold a PhD or post-doctoral experience in a subject area relevant to the profile. Excellent communication skills in written and spoken English and ability to communicate complex information to individuals from a range of disciplines are mandatory.

**Research Environment**: The LIPh group is active on a broad spectrum of subject areas and it is a vibrant, interdisciplinary research team that greatly benefits from collaborations all around the world.

The University of Padova is one of the most prestigious and big universities in Italy. Padova is a small and beautiful town, enriched by cultural and artistic activities and shaped around the University. Low living costs, great food, and you can bike everywhere!

The successful candidate will work in close collaboration with Sandro Azaele, Samir Suweis and Amos Maritan.

**How to apply**: Interested applicants are invited to submit a CV, list of publications and a brief cover letter (max one A4 page). We particularly welcome applications from women or from ethnic minorities.

All material should be sent to liph(dot)unipd(at)gmail(dot)com. ***The deadline for applications is November 7th, 2019***. Later applications will be considered until the position will be filled.
