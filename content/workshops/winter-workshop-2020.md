We have organized two days for a kick-off meeting of our extended LIPh research group, including thus some collaborators and master students. The meeting will be in Folgaria (in picture), at the hotel Vittoria from Thursday 16.01.2020 Saturday 18.01.2020 at lunch (included). Breakfast, lunch and dinner at the hotel restaurant are included in the cost of each room.

The idea is to spend two days together in a nice place, to welcome the new members of our lab and share our research interests and projects: where we are, and where we want to go. <!--[Here](/files/Kick-off-program_LIPhLAB.pdf) you can find the program of the workshop.-->


<!--There is no fee for the conference, but you need to open your mission for the workshop [here](https://webapps.unipd.it/richieste/), so PhDs and Post-docs enrolled at the University of Padova can have the reimbursement for the two nights at the hotel. Unfortunately we are not able to reimburse the expenses for master students and guests.

For guests or for who want to stay more days, the cost of the full board per person per night is 70 euro for double room single use, and 55 euro for double room (shared with another person, i.e. 110 euro for two person).
